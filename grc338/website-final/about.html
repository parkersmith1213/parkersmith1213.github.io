                Welcome to the official Beachside Brew website! We are a new startup coffee shop just off PCH and Seal Beach Boulevard. This is a family owned buisness founded by Parker, Prestyn, and Peyton Smith. </p>
            
            <p> At Beachside Brew, we do our absolute best to provide our customers with high-end, self brewed coffee, teas, and freshly cooked food. We provide a variety of flavors made from scratch as well as our signiture lattes and cold brew!</p>
            
            <p> This business originally began due to the lack of quality coffee in the Seal Beach area. My sisters and I wanted to create a place that provided this town with not only amazing products, but a place to hang out with friends, study, or even just take in the view! </p>
            <p>From the moment you step into our welcoming beachside cafe, you're greeted with the irresistible aroma of freshly roasted beans and the sound of waves crashing nearby. Our skilled baristas are dedicated to perfecting each cup, whether it's a classic espresso, a velvety latte, or a refreshing cold brew.</p>
            
            <p> At Beachside Brew, we believe in more than just great coffee; we believe in fostering connections, celebrating coastal living, and savoring every moment, one cup at a time.</p>
